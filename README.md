## Overview

This project serves as an educational resource for understanding an ideal frontend folder structure and various frontend concepts in React. The structure is designed to enhance maintainability, scalability, and clarity of the codebase.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **assets**: Contains static files like images, fonts, and icons that are used throughout the application.

- **components**: Includes reusable UI components, structured into smaller subfolders based on their type (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms).

- **constants**: Houses constant values used across the application, such as API URLs, text placeholders, and configuration settings.

- **pages**: Contains the main pages of the application, representing different routes and views.

- **plugins**: Includes third-party libraries or plugins that enhance functionality.

- **routes**: Manages the applicationâ€™s routing configuration, defining how different URLs correspond to components.

- **services**: Contains functions for handling API calls and business logic, abstracting data-fetching operations.

- **store**: Manages the state of the application, typically using state management libraries like Redux or Context API.

- **tests**: Contains test files for components and services, ensuring that the application behaves as expected.

- **types**: Holds TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the project to enforce type safety.

- **utils**: Contains utility functions that provide common functionality, helping to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **React Router**: For handling routing and navigation within the application.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to backend services.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling components locally.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-name>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you can view the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion
